In case you need help or advice, reaching an expert at the service desk is only a click away with our instant video support feature. Make a call and let your colleagues at the office see exactly what you’re seeing. Discuss the problem, solve it, move on.</p>

                  <p>Getting the job done is important, but getting it done well - with proof to show for it - is crucial. For any work you perform, you would need a second pair of eyes to do a quality check. But that doesn’t necessarily have to happen in person, at least not with our GemVision technology.<br/>
                  Simply give a voice command to take a picture or video of the job you have done, and share it with a colleague at the office. With our visual collaboration tool, they can draw or write straight onto the file they receive, and give their feedback and/or approve in real time.</p>

                      Managing hundreds of field workers - keeping track of where they are, what they are working on, and how they are performing - can be stressful. You don’t have to convince us about it.<br/>
                      We’ve designed our Helpdesk dashboard to make your day-to-day work that much easier. View planned field activities ahead of time and use our GPS feature to keep track the progress of all on-site engineers. Gain insights into their efficiency, and assign them to new tasks based on their proximity and expertise. To add to that, use our business intelligence (BI) tool to keep tabs on the work performed, collect and analyze relevant data, and essentially be able to better predict repair and maintenance needs. Quick and easy, with no time wasted.
