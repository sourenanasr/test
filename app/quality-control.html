          <p>Getting the job done is important, but getting it done well - with proof to show for it - is crucial. For any work you perform, you would need a second pair of eyes to do a quality check. But that doesnâ€™t necessarily have to happen in person, at least not with our GemVision technology.<br/>
            Simply give a voice command to take a picture or video of the job you have done, and share it with a colleague at the office. With our visual collaboration tool, they can draw or write straight onto the file they receive, and give their feedback and/or approve in real time.</p>
