          <p>Working in the field doesn’t necessarily mean working far away from the office. Well, not literally at least. In case you need help or advice, reaching an expert at the service desk is only a click away with our instant video support feature. Make a call and let your colleagues at the office see exactly what you’re seeing. Discuss the problem, solve it, move on.</p>
